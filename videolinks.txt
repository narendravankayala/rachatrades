what is going on everybody i hope you
all have had a great weekend so far and are looking forward to the start of this
trading week

um so in this in this video what i'm going to do is trying to explain more in
depth of how i

use the ema system to my favor i'm not going to go too much in depth because
it's pretty self-explanatory however

there are a few things that i want to cover so on the left side of the chart i
have the

20 day 10 minute chart up and
i have the ema clouds up here as well so

on the 10 minute chart uh this is the 5 ema this is the 12.

this is the

34 and this is the 50 ema and so what i soon realized was this is
one of the most powerful intraday slash

swing trading
um basically trend falling indicators

out there this was with a lot of back
testing i mean again just on the 10

minute chart you can see all the i mean
this whole leg down

was backed behind
you know the system and then finally we

can see that we have the

the 5 and 12 across the 34 and 50 which gave us a huge upside run

and then we get back under and then this

right here was the start of the leg up we are currently in and it all started

with the 5 and 12 ema crossing the 34

and 50.
and so what i what i realized was

well if this is an amazing trend

indicating
trend indicator i wonder if i could

replicate that to say a one minute chart

with the same basically 10 minute
candles

and so what i ended up doing was since

it's this is a ten minute chart
and it's a five

ema what i did was i just did ten times

five so that gives you the 50 ema on the one minute chart

and then for the 12 ema on the 10 minute

chart that gives you 120 ema on the one minute chart and so on and so forth so

the 34 ema on a 10 minute chart is a 340

on the one minute chart five and the 50 is a 500

and so what i began doing was saying

okay you know this is an amazing
indicator and it works super well in the

10 minutes what if i can minimize my

risk and maximize my maximize
my reward by using it on one minute

chart and so really what i want to show

you guys is
by using the system on a one minute

chart

what you'll end up seeing is
as long as we are trading above the five

and 12 which is the 50 and 120 on the

one minute chart we are considered to be in a strong uptrend you know whether

that's intraday or swing trading it's

all dependent on the time frame that you choose to trade it on you don't have to

marry the 10-minute chart you don't have

to marry the one-minute chart it works on all time frames so for if it's an

hour chart and we're trading above the

five
and 12 ema then that's in an uptrend i'm

going to be looking for buys

but um what i want to show you guys is
kind of you know if you ever just zoom

out and you look at price action

like right here on the left side of the chart

this

this right here this is a strong
uptrending day why do i say that

because we don't have one candle close

below the 12 ema okay and so when we come over to the

to the one minute chart

and we highlight

or put a rectangle around

the wicks okay we're going to put them

around the wicks where they rejected it on the 10 minute chart

so we have body closes within i mean we

even have this super far extended look down but we still close within

the the 12 ema

so i'm going to draw the rectangle
there we have a few more nice reactions

here

as well as here and so what you'll see is the same levels on my 10-minute chart

on the one-minute chart

when we zoom in
they are really

representative of the risk to reward you

can get so when you're trading or
intraday trading

the most important thing you need to

understand is i like having up the 10 minute and the one minute side by side

because even though on this candle right

here
that wicks

that wicks real really far down well

when that opened
it was red on the one minute chart all

the way down until we closed within and

it's a pin hammer so that's a very
bullish signal and so when we come over

here this is

the 10 minute chart
with um

basically this is the wick on the

10-minute chart and so when we reclaim back in the 12 ema right here you go

long i mean it's really that simple what

you want to do is you wait to see if the 10 minute closes within the 5 and 12 ema

and if it does you can go long so for

example over here we're closing within but we're getting lower and the second

we close below it just absolutely
